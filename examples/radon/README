The data for this model comes from https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/blob/master/ARM/Ch.22/srrs2.dat. The model is adapted from https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/radon.html.

To run this code, navigate to the root cmdstan directory. Build the model with:

```
make examples/radon/radon
```

Run it with the new adaptation using:

```
examples/radon/radon sample adapt experimental=1 which_adaptation=0 delta=0.8 algorithm=hmc metric=dense_e data file=examples/radon/radon.dat
```

Run it with the new adaptation requiring a diagonal metric using:

```
examples/radon/radon sample adapt experimental=1 which_adaptation=0 delta=0.8 algorithm=hmc metric=diag_e data file=examples/radon/radon.dat
```

The 'which_adaptation' argument can be used to force different adaptations. The available options are given on running with the switching adaptation (the numbers marked 'which'):

```
